# net-http

Very minimal http(2) client based on jdk11+ HttpClient.

## Approach

We just supply very thin wrappers over client instantiation and
response/request handling. All the heavy lifting is done via an
interceptor chain that is 1st class.

By default it supports ring and ring2 style request/response, but you
could also hit the response/request protocol functions direclty if you
want/need to use a more imperative style (and more gc friendly) api.

## Usage

By default it will use the ring1 style api:

``` clj
(require '[exoscale.net.http.client :as c])

;; creates a new client instance
(def c (c/client {}))

;; perform request, everything goes through that single function, no (get ...) (post ...), etc.
@(c/request c {:method :get
               :url "http://google.com/"
               :query-params {:foo :bar}
               :form-params {:foo :bar1}})
```

It will use the async interface of the underlying client,
so it will return a CompletableFuture.

You can see the various client options in the
`exoscale.net.http.client.option` ns.

You can also pass additional keys to the context (request map) to alter behavior:

Response options:

* `:exoscale.net.http.client.response/body-handler`
* `:exoscale.net.http.client.response/executor`

Body handler options are in `exoscale.net.http.client.response`, some
of them can also take extra arguments:

- possible values are `:discarding` `:string` `:byte-array`
`:input-stream` `:publisher` `:byte-array-consumer` `:file`
`:file-download` `:subscriber` `:line-subscriber` `:buffering`
`:replacing` `:lines`.

Request options:

* `exoscale.net.http.client.request/async?` (defaults  to true)
* `exoscale.net.http.client.request/throw-on-error?` (defaults  to true)

Request body is handled via
`exoscale.net.http.client.request/BodyPublisher` by default it will
handle: bytes, string, input-stream and HttpRequest$BodyPublishers.

For now the docs are almost non-existant but the source is quite
minimal. That will come in time, once the api stabilizes.

## Exceptional http statuses

Exceptional http statuses will cause a throw with an exoscale.ex
anomaly type ex-info. You can see the mapping here: https://github.com/exoscale/ex/blob/master/modules/ex-http/src/clj/exoscale/ex/http.clj.

You can disable that by modifying the interceptor chain used by `request` calls

## Things it doesn't do

Right now we do not aim with clj-http compatibility, it's
intentionally minimalistic, this make it very predictable and low
overhead.  If you need special handling of array params
(`?a[]=foo&a[]=bar`, etc), multipart upload and these kind things you
have to create interceptors yourself to do it, it's quite easy, most
libraries that did that just copy some of the helper namespaces from
clj-http, we'd suggest you'd do that on a case by case basis.
